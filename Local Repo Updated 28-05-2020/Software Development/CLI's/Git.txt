- 'git add <file>' : add file(s) to staging area. 
  - 'git add (.)' : adds all files in directory
  - 'git add (*.filetype)' : adds all files of the same type
- 'git status' : see what you have in the staging area and ready for commit.
- 'git commit' / 'git commit -m 'CHANGES MESSAGE'': commit changes in the staging area into the local git repository.
- 'git push' : push to remote repository(github).
- 'git pull' : pull the latest changes from the remote repository.
