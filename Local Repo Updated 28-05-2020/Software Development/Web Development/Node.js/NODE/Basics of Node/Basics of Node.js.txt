>> What is Node.js
- Node.js is a Javascript runtime built on Chrome's V8 Javascript engine. Basically Javascript running on the server.
- A platform which allows us to run Javascript on a computer/server.
- Read, delete and update files.
- Easily communicate with a database. 
- Very fast(runs on the V8 engine & uses non-blocking code).
- Huge ecosystem of open source packages (npm).
- Great for real-time services (like chats).
- Used to build powerful, fast & scalable web applications.
- Uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.


>> Non-blocking I/O 
- Node.js works on a single thread using non-blocing I/O calls
- Node.js supports tens of thousands concurrent connections.
- Node.js optimizes throughput and scalability in web applications with many I/O operations.
- This makes Node.js apps extremely fast and efficient.


>> Event Loop
- Single-threaded.
- Supports concurrency via events and callbacks.
- EventEmitter class is used to bind events and event listeners.


>> The V8 Engine
- Computers do not understand Javascript.
- A Javascript engine takes Javascript, and converts it into something it does understand - machine code. 
- Node.js is written in C++.
- At the heart of Node.js is the V8 engine.
- The V8 engine converts out JS into machine code.


>> What Can We Build With Node.js?
- REST API's & Backend Applications.
- Real-Time Services (Chat, Games, etc).
- CRUD Apps - Blogs, Content Management Systems, Social Applications.
- Utilities & Tools.
- Anything that is not CPU-intensive!


>> NPM
- Node.js Package Manager.
- Used to install node programs/modules.
- Easy to specify and link dependencies.
- Modules get installed into the "node_modules" folder. 
- All dependencies are listed in a "package.json" file.
- NPM scripts can be created to run certain tasks such as run a server.


>> Node Modules
- Node Modules are 3rd party modules/packages installed via NPM.
- You can alsi create custom modules (files).

=> Popular Modules
- Express: Web development framework
- Connect: Extensible HTTP server framework
- Socket.io: Server side component for websockets
- Pug / Jade: Template engine inspired by HAML
- Mongo / Mongoose: Wrappers to interact with MongoDB
- Coffee-Script: CoffeeScript compiler
- Redis: Redis client library


>> package.json File
- Goes in the root of your package/application
- Tells npm how your package is structured and what to do to install it.
- Can be set up manually or by using command 'npm init'
