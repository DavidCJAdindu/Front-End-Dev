/*
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a month (using integers between 1 and 12); the program should determine and output the number of days in a given month; the program should also prompt the user to enter the year when the month is 2 (February) so that it can display whether the number of days is 28 or 29 (a leap year is every year divisible by four except for years which are both divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400; for example, the year 2000 is a leap year, but the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not); the program should also display an appropriate message if the user entered an invalid month.
