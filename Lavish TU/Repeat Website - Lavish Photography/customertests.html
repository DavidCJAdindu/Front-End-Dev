		We had David as our wedding photographer at The Heritage, Killenard in August. He was absolutely brilliant. Very easy-going and accommodating. Really had everyone at ease, which can be difficult with wedding photos. Moved about the crowd and took loads of candid shots for us. Switched between taking our formal photos and candid shots to give us a break naturally. Stayed with us all day from the prep right through to the first dance. Very easy company and totally unobtrusive with the camera. The photos are absolutely beautiful-easy online service to view them, now if only I could manage to choose between so many gorgeous shots for the album!!! Thanks a million David!

		Would highly recommend Ole. He goes out and beyond to get the perfect picture and is kind and so understanding especially when your 2 year old just doesn't want to be there. Chloe is delighted and thinks she is famous with her picture in the window!

		Words can't describe the professionalism you meet from first call to when you walk through door. Clients are put at ease even those who never liked photos will soon be beaming as the fab staff combine banter, humour, laughter into the photo shoot. Both David and Ole are a pleasure to deal with.
		Ole in particular is a breath of fresh air at his ability to make people relax.  
		Great service ... great humour... great photos... great price

		Want to say a huge thank you to David And also Ole.
		David did a great job on our christening. His experience in photography really showed on the day. I didn't notice him taking the majority of pictures. He knew our church and venue like the back of his hand. Our albums are fabulous. I could not recommend him enough. Such a nice man to top it all off. The efficient service afterwards was also a huge bonus. Thanks David, and thanks Ole you were great at getting in contact and sorting everything out. Will be down to the studio with the kids.

		Just want to say a massive thank you to David who kindly done our wedding on the 30th of June. You captured special moments on our big day. You are a fantastic photographer and I can't thank you enough for making our special day magical. Our wedding album is amazing and I will always be very grateful for your kindness. You went above and beyond for me and my husband. Also Ole did an Amazing job on my son's school photos 3 weeks ago. Thank you guys so much.

		David did an absolutely wonderful job with our family portraits. Not only did he take beautiful pictures of us, but the service we experienced was first class as well! I can recommend his services to anyone who's looking to capture their memories in the form of a photograph. Thank you David!
